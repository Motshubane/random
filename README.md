Brief: Create a Random Quote Generator

Summary:
Create an app that displays random quotes at the push of a button.

Details:
The details of the project can be found on FreeCodeCamp.
https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine

You will need to review the preceding section on FreeCodeCamp titled “JSON APIs and Ajax” to learn how to query APIs for your quote generator.

Don’t look at the example code on CodePen. After you review the JSON/APIs section, write out all the steps you will need to complete the project. This a good opportunity to practice using pseudocode!

Requirements:

Complete the FreeCodeCamp challenge (including the ability for a user to tweet the quote)
Don’t use CodePen
Use your local text editor to create your JS, HTML, and CSS project files
Give your Quote Generator a unique style (fonts, colors, etc. Make sure it is readable and user-friendly)
Upload your finished app on to your personal website on GitHub pages
